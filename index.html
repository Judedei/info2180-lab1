 <h2>Juddy-Shae Wallace</h2>
 <p>Paragraph about Myself:  My name is Juddy-Shae Wallace and I was born in Mandeville in the year Y2k,
     which according to the Chinese Calendar is the year of the Dragons.
     This is ironic, as I firmly believe that my spirit animal is that of a domesticated 
     rabbit, and I've been told that on occaison that I resemble them.
     I was raised in St.  Elizabeth for the first five years of my life, after 
     which I moved to Kingston where I now reside.  A lot of my interests are determined
     by my religious beliefs as I am a firm believer in God, so I spend most of my time watching
     a diverse set of topics on youtube; from political and religious comentary,
     cooking channels and sketchbook tours, to ferrets dancing to Buttercup by Jack Stauber on Youtube.
     I enjoy foods from other cultures, but my favourite is Chinese, the Szechuan Chicken from
     Northside Chicken, being my favourite to date. My ideal social scene is more laid-back and 
     intimate vibe as I prefer a small gathering with close friends where there's no pressure to
     fit in. My goals in life is to pursue Christ always, to attain a masters in Data Science,
     and to be the best possible version of myself each day. </p>

 <p> Paragraph about why I am interested in Web Dev:  My interest in Web development began when I started
     using Tumblr (desktop version) as a teenager. I was always interested in decorating my page to be as 
     expressive of myself as i am via the use of stickers, gifs and images. I was also interested in the different
     themes. My favourite of which is seeing how others have applied snowing background images and 
     Japanese blossoms. Web development isn't limited to this, however, it is what has gotten me interested. 
     Seeing as I eventually wish to own my own Art shop where I sell prints of my artwork, this course is a game-changer
     in standing out among the billions of other webpages on the internet. I also heard from my peers that this course
     is fun and useful in other courses.
